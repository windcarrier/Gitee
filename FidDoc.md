StrBasicData.CStructEdge Class only support the divide line first intersect 
StrBasicData.CStructEdge Class only support the divide line first intersect 
point index smaller than the last intersect point. if the first intersect 
index bigger than the last one, the first new Edge can't be get(only get by test).
So, if has some time it need to be fixed.
